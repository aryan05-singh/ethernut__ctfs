Sloution of given problem
-> The challenge in the "first level" usually requires you to become the owner of the contract.
To solve this, first call the `contribute()` function with less than 0.001 ether. Then, send a small amount (e.g., 1 wei) directly to the contract,
triggering the `receive()` function and becoming the owner. Finally, call `withdraw()` to drain the contract.
